# StreamPipes

StreamPipes enables flexible modeling of stream processing pipelines by providing a graphical modeling editor on top of existing stream processing frameworks.

It leverages non-technical users to quickly define and execute processing pipelines based on an easily extensible 
toolbox of data sources, data processors and data sinks.

### StreamPipes Pipeline Elements Examples

The pipeline elements defined in this repository **do nothing** - they only serve to provide examples on how pipeline 
elements can be created with StreamPipes. The examples are referenced in the SDK guide 
(https://docs.streampipes.org/docs/dev-guide-introduction)

If you are looking for **real** pipeline elements that can be installed in StreamPipes, have a look at
